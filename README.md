# WebScraping

This Python script scrapes the top-rated movies on IMDb and stores their movie rank, name, year of release, and IMDb rating in an Excel spreadsheet. The code uses the requests library to send a GET request to the IMDb website, and the beautifulsoup4 library to parse the HTML content of the page. It then loops through each movie element to extract its details and appends it to the Excel spreadsheet.
